# Gland Segmentation from Three-dimensional Light Sheet Microscopy Images in Prostate Cancer

Glandular features play an important role in the evaluation of prostate cancer. There has been significant interest in the use of 2D pathomics (feature extraction) approaches for detection, diagnosis, and characterization of prostate cancer on digitized tissue slide images. With the development of 3D microscopy techniques, such as open-top light-sheet (OTLS), there is an opportunity for rapid 3D imaging of large tissue specimens such as whole biopsies. In this study, we sought to investigate whether 3D features of gland morphology, namely volume and surface curvature, from OTLS images offer superior discrimination between malignant and benign glands compared to the traditional 2D gland features, namely area and curvature, alone.
